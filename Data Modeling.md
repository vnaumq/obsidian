[Data modeling](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/support-multiple-data-modeling-approaches-with-snowflake/) is the process of organizing and mapping data using simplified diagrams, symbols, and text to represent data associations and flow. 

Engineers use these models to develop new software and to update legacy software. Data modeling also ensures the consistency and quality of data. Data modeling differs from [database schemas](https://www.snowflake.com/data-cloud-glossary/schema-database/). A schema is a database blueprint while a data model is an overarching design that determines what can exist in the schema.

## BENEFITS OF DATA MODELING

- Improved accuracy, standardization, consistency, and predictability of data
- Expanded access to actionable insights
- Smoother integration of data systems with less development time
- Faster, less expensive maintenance and updates of software
- Quicker identification of errors and omissions
- Reduced risk
- Better collaboration between teams, including non-developers
- Expedited training and onboarding for anyone accessing data
