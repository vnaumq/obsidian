Questions

- In English, there are two basic types of question.
    
    1. **Yes/no questions** often begin with the verb **to be**, but can also begin with other **auxiliary verbs**, such as **do**.
    
    We ask these when we want a **yes** or **no** answer.
    
    2. **W****h-questions** start with a question word, such as **who**, **what**, **where**, **when**, **why** or **how**.
    
    We ask this type of question when we want **different kinds of information**. These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.
