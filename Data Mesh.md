[[Data Management Architecture]]

A data mesh is an architectural framework that solves advanced data security challenges through distributed, decentralized ownership. Organizations have multiple data sources from different lines of business that must be integrated for analytics. A data mesh architecture effectively unites the disparate data sources and links them together through centrally managed data sharing and governance guidelines. Business functions can maintain control over how shared data is accessed, who accesses it, and in what formats it’s accessed. A data mesh adds complexities to architecture but also brings efficiency by improving data access, security, and scalability.

## What challenges does a data mesh solve?

Even though organizations have access to ever-increasing data volume, they have to sort, filter, process, and analyze the data to derive practical benefits. Organizations often utilize a central team of engineers and scientists for managing data. The team uses a centralized data platform for the following purposes:

- Ingest the data from all the different business units (or business domains).
- Transform the data into a consistent, trustworthy, and useful format. For example, the team could make sure all dates in the system are in a common format or summarize daily reports.
- Prepare the data for data consumers, like by generating reports for humans or preparing XML files for applications. [Read about XML »](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/xml/)

As data volume increases, organizations face increasing costs to maintain the same agility as before. The monolithic system is difficult to scale because of the following reasons.
