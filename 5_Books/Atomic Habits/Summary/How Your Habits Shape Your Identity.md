[[Atomic Habits]]

- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself
