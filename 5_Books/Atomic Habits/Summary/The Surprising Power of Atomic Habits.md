[[Atomic Habits]]

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential 
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient 
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results
- If you want better results, then forget about settings goals. Focus on your system instead
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your system
