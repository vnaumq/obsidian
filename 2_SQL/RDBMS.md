## What Is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a kind of database management system ([[DBMS]]) that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. This organization allows users to access and manipulate data in relation to other data within the database, hence the term "relational". RDBMS is widely used in various fields, including finance, telecom, healthcare, and more for data storage, management, and analysis.

## History

The first RDBMS was developed by IBM in the 1970s, inspired by the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd. Since then, several versions and varieties have evolved, with popular implementations including Oracle Database, MySQL, and PostgreSQL among others.

## Functionality and Features

RDBMSs are characterized by their use of tables to store data, provision for [SQL](https://www.dremio.com/wiki/structured-query-language-sql/) (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation, and ACID compliance for transaction reliability. They support data integrity rules and constraints to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Most RDBMSs also provide interfaces and tools for administrators to control database operation and access.

## Architecture

Typically, an RDBMS architecture comprises three main layers: External, Conceptual, and Internal. The External layer handles user interaction, the Conceptual layer defines the logical structure of the database, and the Internal layer manages physical data storage.

## Benefits and Use Cases

RDBMSs are advantageous due to their data integrity, efficiency, and security features. They are widely used for managing and processing structured data, developing enterprise applications, and supporting [online transaction processing](https://www.dremio.com/wiki/online-transaction-processing/) ([[OLTP]]) and online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]) workloads.
