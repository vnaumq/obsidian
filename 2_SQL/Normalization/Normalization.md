Normalization is an important process in database design that helps improve the database’s efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. It makes it easier to manage and maintain the data and ensures that the database is adaptable to changing business needs.

Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes of the database to reduce or eliminate data redundancy (having the same data but at different places).

## Why do we need Normalization?

The primary objective for normalizing the relations is to eliminate the below anomalies. Failure to reduce anomalies results in data redundancy, which may threaten data integrity and cause additional issues as the database increases. Normalisation consists of a set of procedures that assist you in developing an effective database structure.

- Insertion Anomalies
- Deletion anomalies
- Updation anomalies

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***First Normal Form ([[1NF]])***       | A relation is in [first normal form](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-normal-form-1nf/) if every attribute in that relation is single-valued attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ***Second Normal Form ([[2NF]])***      | A relation that is in First Normal Form and every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key, then the relation is in [Second Normal Form (2NF).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/second-normal-form-2nf/)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ***Third Normal Form ([[3NF]])***       | A relation is in the [third normal form](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/third-normal-form-3nf/), if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well as it is in the second normal form. A relation is in 3NF if at least one of the following conditions holds in every non-trivial function dependency X –> Y.<br><br>- X is a super key.<br>- Y is a prime attribute (each element of Y is part of some candidate key). |
| ***Boyce-Codd Normal Form ([[BCNF]])*** | For BCNF the relation should satisfy the below conditions<br><br>- The relation should be in the 3rd Normal Form.<br>- X should be a superkey for every functional dependency (FD) X−>Y in a given relation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ***Fourth Normal Form ([[4NF]])***      | A relation R is in [4NF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-4th-and-5th-normal-form-in-dbms/) if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: <br><br>- It should be in the [Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boyce-codd-normal-form-bcnf/).<br>- The table should not have any Multi-valued Dependency.                                                                                      |
| ***Fifth Normal Form ([[5NF]])***       | A relation R is in [5NF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fifth-normal-form-5nf-in-dbms/) if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:<br><br>- R should be already in 4NF. <br>- It cannot be further non loss decomposed (join dependency).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
