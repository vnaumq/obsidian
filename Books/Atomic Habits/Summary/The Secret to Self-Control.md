[[Atomic Habits]]

- The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible 
- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten 
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one
