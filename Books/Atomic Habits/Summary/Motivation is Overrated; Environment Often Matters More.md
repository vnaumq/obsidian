[[Atomic Habits]]

- Small changes  in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time 
- Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment 
- Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues
