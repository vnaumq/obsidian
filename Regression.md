A [regression model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#regression-model) predicts a numeric value. For example, a weather model that predicts the amount of rain, in inches or millimeters, is a regression model.

See the table below for more examples of regression models:

|Scenario|Possible input data|Numeric prediction|
|---|---|---|
|Future house price|Square footage, zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, mortgage interest rate, property tax rate, construction costs, and number of homes for sale in the area.|The price of the home.|
|Future ride time|Historical traffic conditions (gathered from smartphones, traffic sensors, ride-hailing and other navigation applications), distance from destination, and weather conditions.|The time in minutes and seconds to arrive at a destination.|
