****Integration testing**** is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules. It focuses on determining the correctness of the interface. The purpose of integration testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Once all the modules have been unit-tested, integration testing is performed.
## What is Integration Testing? 
Integration testing is a [software testing technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-techniques/) that focuses on verifying the interactions and data exchange between different components or modules of a software application. The goal of integration testing is to identify any problems or bugs that arise when different components are combined and interact with each other. Integration testing is typically performed after unit testing and before system testing. It helps to identify and resolve integration issues early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of more severe and costly problems later on. 

Integration testing is one of the basic type of software testing and there are many other basic and advance software testing. If you are interested in learning all the testing concept and other more advance concept in the field of the software testing you can

- Integration testing can be done by picking module by module. This can be done so that there should be a proper sequence to be followed. 
- And also if you don’t want to miss out on any integration scenarios then you have to follow the proper sequence. 
- Exposing the defects is the major focus of the integration testing and the time of interaction between the integrated units.
## Why is Integration Testing Important? 

Integration testing is important because it verifies that individual software modules or components work together correctly as a whole system. This ensures that the integrated software functions as intended and helps identify any compatibility or communication issues between different parts of the system. By detecting and resolving integration problems early, integration testing contributes to the overall reliability, performance, and quality of the software product.
## Integration test approaches 

There are four types of integration testing approaches. Those approaches are the following:
