Structured query language (SQL) is a standardized, domain-specific programming language that excels at handling data relationships. It is used extensively for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in systems such as MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle.

When data needs to be retrieved from a database, SQL is used to make the request. SQL is used by database administrators, developers and data analysts for tasks such as data definition, access control, data sharing, writing [data integration](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-integration) scripts and running [analytical queries](https://www.ibm.com/topics/big-data-analytics).

Key functions of SQL:

- **Data definition**: Define the structure and organization of the stored data and the relationships among stored data items.
- **Data retrieval**: Retrieve specific data items or a range of items easily.
- **Data manipulation**: Add new data, remove or modify existing data.
- **Access control**: Restrict a user's ability to retrieve, add and modify data, protecting stored data against unauthorized access.
- **Data sharing**: Used to coordinate data sharing by concurrent users, helping to ensure that changes made by one user do not inadvertently delete or overwrite changes made by other users.
