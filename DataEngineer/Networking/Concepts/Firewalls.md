A firewall is a [network security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-network-security.html) device that separates a trusted internal network from an external network deemed untrustworthy, such as the internet. It regulates incoming and outgoing network traffic based on preset security rules. Firewalls are paramount in shielding networks from unauthorized access, harmful activities, and potential threats, and can exist as hardware, software, software-as-a-service (SaaS), or public or private (virtual) cloud.

Firewalls scrutinize network packets and implement security policies, effectively barring unauthorized users or potentially harmful data from infiltrating or exiting a network. Notably, firewalls serve as gatekeepers, scrutinizing each network packet and deciding whether to permit or block it based on pre-set rules. This helps to ensure that only traffic deemed safe and legitimate is allowed through the firewall.

In addition to these core functions, today's next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) have a range of features to bolster network security. These include deep packet inspection, application visibility and control, intrusion detection and prevention, malware defense, URL filtering, and more.
