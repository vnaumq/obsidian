A cloud-based data warehouse is built to run in the cloud. It is often offered to organizations as a managed data-storage service in which the data warehouse infrastructure is managed by the cloud company. The organization doesn’t need to make an upfront investment in hardware or software, nor does it need to manage its own system. Cloud services often offer flexible pricing as well.
