[[Distributed System Concepts]]

Batch Processing is a paradigm where you wait for an amount of data to collect or some time to pass before the data is processed. 

Batch processing is often used in scenarios where you have large volumes of data, data that isn't time sensitive, and data that can be processed on a set schedule. The example we discussed above was that of a credit card transaction.

Asynchronous processing of data, on the other hand, is used to process data related to events as soon as they occur. 

This approach is often used when dealing with data processed in microservices, user interfaces, and in general with systems needing real time request-response processing. We looked at an example of a chat app in the above discussion and learnt how asynchronous processing of data is applicable to the scenario.
