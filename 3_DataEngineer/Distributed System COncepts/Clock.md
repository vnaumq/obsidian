[[Distributed System Concepts]]

In [distributed systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-distributed-system/), ensuring synchronized events across multiple nodes is crucial for consistency and reliability. Enter logical clocks, a fundamental concept that orchestrates event ordering without relying on physical time. By assigning logical timestamps to events, these clocks enable systems to reason about causality and sequence events accurately, even across network delays and varied system clocks. This article explores how logical clocks enhance distributed system design.

## What are Logical Clocks?

Logical clocks are a concept used in [distributed systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-distributed-system/) to order events without relying on physical time synchronization. They provide a way to establish a partial ordering of events based on causality rather than real-time clock values. 

- By assigning logical timestamps to events, logical clocks allow distributed systems to maintain consistency and coherence across different nodes, despite varying clock speeds and network delays. 
- This ensures that events can be correctly ordered and coordinated, facilitating fault tolerance and reliable operation in distributed computing environments.
