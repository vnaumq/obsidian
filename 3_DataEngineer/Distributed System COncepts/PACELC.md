## What is PACELC Theorem?


PACELC Theorem is a concept in distributed computing that provides insight into the trade-offs between consistency and latency in distributed databases. PACELC stands for Partition, Availability, Consistency, Else, Latency, and Consistency. The theorem states that in the event of a [network partition](https://www.dremio.com/wiki/network-partition/), a distributed system must choose between availability and consistency; otherwise, it must choose between latency and consistency. This theorem has implications on system design and performance, particularly in the context of data processing and analytics for data scientists and technology professionals.

## Functionality and Features

At its core, PACELC Theorem addresses the trade-offs that distributed systems must make in order to ensure data consistency and availability. It extends the [CAP Theorem](https://www.dremio.com/wiki/cap-theorem/), which only addresses the trade-offs in the presence of partitions. The key features of PACELC Theorem include:

- Highlighting trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency
- Guiding system designers to make informed decisions about system architecture and design
- Providing a basis for understanding and evaluating different distributed database systems and their potential impact on data processing and analytics

## Benefits and Use Cases

PACELC Theorem offers the following benefits and use cases:

- Assists in choosing the right distributed database system based on consistency and latency requirements
- Helps data scientists and technology professionals make decisions related to application performance and user experience
- Provides a framework for evaluating trade-offs between different technologies and configurations to achieve optimal data processing and analytics performance
