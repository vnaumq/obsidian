[[Data Management Architecture]]

A _relational data warehouse_ (RDW) is where you centrally store and manage large volumes of structured data copied from multiple data sources to be used for historical and trend analysis reporting so that your company can make better business decisions. It is called _relational_ because it is based on the _relational model_, a widely used approach to data representation and organization for databases. In the relational model, data is organized into tables (also known as relations, hence the name). These tables consist of rows and columns, where each row represents an entity (such as a customer or product) and each column represents an attribute of that entity (like name, price, or quantity). It is called a _data warehouse_ because it collects, stores, and manages massive volumes of structured data from various sources, such as transactional databases, application systems, and external data feeds.

Not all data warehouses are based on the relational model. _Non-relational data warehouses_ include types like columnar, NoSQL, and graph data warehouses. However, relational data warehouses are much more popular and widely adopted, primarily because relational databases have been the dominant data management paradigm for decades. The relational model is well suited for structured data, which is commonly found in business applications. It is also popular due to the widespread use of SQL, which has been the standard language for relational data warehouses for many years.
