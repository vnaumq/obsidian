[[Data Management Architecture]]

A data mart is a data storage system that contains information specific to an organization's business unit. It contains a small and selected part of the data that the company stores in a larger storage system. Companies use a data mart to analyze department-specific information more efficiently. It provides summarized data that key stakeholders can use to quickly make informed decisions. 

For example, a company might store data from various sources, such as supplier information, orders, sensor data, employee information, and financial records in their data warehouse or data lake. However, the company stores information relevant to, for instance, the marketing department, such as social media reviews and customer records, in a data mart.

## How does a data mart compare to other types of data storage systems?

Companies use several different types of data storage systems for data management and analytics. Let’s look at some common types of data storage to understand the context in which companies use data marts.

### **Database**

A database is organized storage that computer systems use to store, search, retrieve, and analyze information. There are various types of databases, such as relational databases. A relational database stores information in tables consisting of rows and columns. Data in different tables is connected by a unique identifier known as a key. Keys are the non-repetitive values in specific columns.

#### ***Data mart vs. database***

A data mart serves as the front-facing element for a department’s data.  You can use a data mart to retrieve and analyze information. Meanwhile, a database collects, manages, and stores information. You can then use tools to process, format, and transfer the stored information to a data mart.
