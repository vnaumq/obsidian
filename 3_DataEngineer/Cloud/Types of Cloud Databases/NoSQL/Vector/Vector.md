[[NoSQL]]

Vector databases differ from traditional relational databases like [SQL](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5804-what-is-sql.html) and non-relational databases like [NoSQL](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-nosql/) in several key ways. First and foremost, vector databases are optimized for the storage and retrieval of vector data, whereas SQL and NoSQL databases are optimized for the storage and retrieval of structured and unstructured data, respectively.

### What are the advantages of vector databases?

One of the main advantages of vector databases is their ability to perform high-dimensional similarity search. This means that they can quickly find and retrieve vectors that are similar to a given query vector, even when working with millions or billions of vectors. This is a critical capability in many machine learning and computer vision applications, where identifying similar objects or patterns is a key task.

Another advantage of vector databases is their ability to perform vector arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, and dot product, directly on the stored vectors. This makes it possible to perform complex vector operations quickly and efficiently, which can be useful in many machine learning and scientific computing applications.

Vector databases also tend to have specialized data structures and algorithms that are optimized for vector data. For example, many vector databases use an indexing technique called a “vector quantization tree” or “k-d tree” to organize and search for vectors efficiently. Other databases use different indexing techniques, such as locality-sensitive hashing, to achieve similar results.

### When should you choose a vector database?

Overall, the choice between a vector database and a traditional relational or non-relational database will depend on the specific needs of your application. If your application involves working with vector data, such as image or audio analysis, natural language processing, or recommendation systems, then a vector database may be the best choice. On the other hand, if your application involves working with structured or unstructured data, such as financial records or customer data, then a traditional SQL or NoSQL database may be a better fit.
