[[NoSQL]]

The NoSQL graph database is a technology for data management designed to handle very large sets of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data. The semantic graph database (also known as RDF triplestore) is a type of NoSQL graph database that is capable of integrating heterogeneous data from many sources and making links between datasets. It focuses on the relationships between entities and is able to infer new knowledge out of existing information.

## NoSQL Graph Database Vs. Relational Database

The traditional approach to data management, the relational database, was developed in the 1970s to help enterprises store structured information. The relational database needs its schema (the definition how data is organized and how the relations are associated) to be defined before any new information is added.

Today, however, mobile, social and Internet of Things (IoT) data is everywhere, with unstructured real-time data piling up by the minute. Apart from handling a massive amount of data of all kind, the NoSQL graph database does not need its schema re-defined before adding new data.

This makes the graph database much more flexible, dynamic and lower-cost in integrating new data sources than relational databases.

Compared to the moderate data velocity from one or few locations of the relational databases, NoSQL graph databases are able to store, retrieve, integrate and analyze high-velocity data coming from many locations.
## The Benefits of the Semantic Graph Database

Apart from rich semantic models, semantic graph databases use the globally developed W3C standards for representing data on the Web. The use of standard practices makes [data integration](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/semantic-data-integration/), exchange and mapping to other datasets easier and lowers the risk of vendor lock-in while working with a graph database.

One of those standards is the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a kind of unique ID for all things linked so that we can distinguish between them or know that one thing from one dataset is the same as another in a different dataset. The use of URIs not only reduces costs in integrating data from disparate sources, it also makes data publishing and sharing easier with mapping to [Linked (Open) Data](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/linked-data-linked-open-data/).

Ontotext’s [GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) is able to use [inference](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-inference/), that is, to infer new links out of existing explicit statements in the RDF triplestore. Inference enriches the graph database by creating new knowledge and gives organizations the ability to see all their data highly interlinked. Thus, enterprises have more insights at hand to use in their decision-making processes.
