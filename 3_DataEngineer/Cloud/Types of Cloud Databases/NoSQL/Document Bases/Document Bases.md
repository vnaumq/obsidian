[[NoSQL]]

A [document database](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) is a type of [NoSQL database](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/) that can be used to store and query data as JSON-like documents. [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/what-is-json/) is an open data interchange format that is both human and machine-readable. Developers can use JSON documents in their code and save them directly into the document database. The flexible, semi-structured, and hierarchical nature of documents and document databases allows them to evolve with applications’ needs.
