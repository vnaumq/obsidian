**Online transactional processing (OLTP)** enables the real-time execution of large numbers of database transactions by large numbers of people, typically over the internet.

OLTP is what enables the rapid, accurate data processing behind ATMs and online banking, cash registers and ecommerce, and scores of other services we interact with each day.

In OLTP, the common, defining characteristic of any database transaction is its [[Atomicity]](or indivisibility)—a transaction either succeeds as a whole or fails (or is canceled). It cannot remain in a pending or intermediate state.

# Characteristics of OLTP systems

- Process a large number of relatively simple transactions

- Enable multi-user access to the same data, while ensuring data integrity

- Emphasize very rapid processing, with response times measured in milliseconds:

- Provide indexed data sets
# Examples of OLTP systems

Since the inception of the internet and the e-commerce era, OLTP systems have grown ubiquitous. They’re found in nearly every industry or vertical market and in many consumer-facing systems. Everyday examples of OLTP systems include the following:

- ATM machines 
- Credit card payment processing 
- Order entry 
- Online bookings 
- Record keeping
