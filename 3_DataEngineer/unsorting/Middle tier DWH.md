[[DataEngineer]]
This tier is traditionally built around an analytics engine, most often an [[OLAP]] system that is designed to deliver fast analytics and query speed. 
Three types of OLAP models can be used in this tier:
- Relational online analytical processing ([[ROLAP]]), which enables multidimension data analysis of relational databases.
- Multidimensional online analytical processing ([[MOLAP]]), which uses array-based multidimension storage engines to create multidimensional views of data.
- Hybrid online analytical processing ([[HOLAP]]), which merges [[ROLAP]] and [[MOLAP]] capabilities.
