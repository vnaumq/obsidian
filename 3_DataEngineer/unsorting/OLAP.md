OLAP (online analytical processing) is technology for performing high-speed complex queries or multidimensional analysis on large volumes of data in a [[DWH]], [[Data lake]]. OLAP is used in [[BI]], decision support

# What is an OLAP cube?

The core of most OLAP systems, the OLAP cube is an array-based multidimensional database that makes it possible to process and analyze multiple data dimensions much more quickly and efficiently than a traditional [relational database](https://www.ibm.com/topics/relational-databases).

OLAP that works directly with a multidimensional OLAP cube is known as _multidimensional OLAP,_ or _MOLAP_. Again, for most uses, [[MOLAP]] is the fastest and most practical type of multidimensional data analysis.

However, there are two other types of OLAP which may be preferable in certain cases:
- [[ROLAP ]]
- [[HOLAP]]
