Originally coined by the former CTO of Pentaho, a data lake is a low-cost storage environment, which typically houses petabytes of raw data.

Unlike a data warehouse, a data lake can store both structured and unstructured data, and it does not require a defined schema to store data, a characteristic known as “schema-on-read.”
