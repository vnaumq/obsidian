[OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user. It replaced OAuth 1.0 in 2012 and is now the de facto industry standard for online authorization. OAuth 2.0 provides consented access and restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources on behalf of the user, without ever sharing the user's credentials.

Although the web is the main platform for OAuth 2, the specification also describes how to handle this kind of delegated access to other client types (browser-based applications, server-side web applications, native/mobile apps, connected devices, etc.)

## How Does OAuth 2.0 Work?

At the most basic level, before OAuth 2.0 can be used, the Client must acquire its own credentials, a _client id _ and _client secret_, from the Authorization Server in order to identify and authenticate itself when requesting an Access Token.

Using OAuth 2.0, access requests are initiated by the Client, e.g., a mobile app, website, smart TV app, desktop application, etc. The token request, exchange, and response follow this general flow:

1. The Client requests authorization (authorization request) from the Authorization server, supplying the client id and secret to as identification; it also provides the scopes and an endpoint URI (redirect URI) to send the Access Token or the Authorization Code to.
    
2. The Authorization server authenticates the Client and verifies that the requested scopes are permitted.
    
3. The Resource owner interacts with the Authorization server to grant access.
    
4. The Authorization server redirects back to the Client with either an Authorization Code or Access Token, depending on the grant type, as it will be explained in the next section. A Refresh Token may also be returned.
    
5. With the Access Token, the Client requests access to the resource from the Resource server.
