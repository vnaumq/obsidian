# Introduction to JSON Web Tokens

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the **HMAC** algorithm) or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.

Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on _signed_ tokens. Signed tokens can verify the _integrity_ of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens _hide_ those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:
- **Authorization**
- **Information Exchange**

## What is the JSON Web Token structure?

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (`.`), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

`xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

Let's break down the different parts.

### Header

The header _typically_ consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

For example:

```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Then, this JSON is **Base64Url** encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

### Payload

The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: _registered_, _public_, and _private_ claims.

- [**Registered claims**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1): These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: **iss** (issuer), **exp** (expiration time), **sub** (subject), **aud**(audience), and [others](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1).
    
    > Notice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is meant to be compact.
    
- [**Public claims**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.2): These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the [IANA JSON Web Token Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.
    
- [**Private claims**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.3): These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither _registered_ or _public_claims.
    

An example payload could be:

```
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

The payload is then **Base64Url** encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.

> Do note that for signed tokens this information, though protected against tampering, is readable by anyone. Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted.

### Signature

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.
