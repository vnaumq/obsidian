## What is a VPN?

A VPN or Virtual Private Network creates a private network connection between devices through the internet. VPNs are used to safely and anonymously transmit data over public networks. They work by masking user IP addresses and encrypting data so it's unreadable by anyone not authorized to receive it.

## What is a VPN used for?

VPN services are mainly used to safely send data over the internet. The three main functions of VPNs are:

### 1. Privacy

Without a virtual private network, your personal data like passwords, credit card information, and browsing history can be recorded and sold by third parties. VPNs use encryption to keep this confidential information private, especially when connecting over public wi-fi networks. 

### 2. Anonymity

Your IP address contains information about your location and browsing activity. All websites on the Internet track this data using cookies and similar technology. They can identify you whenever you visit them. A VPN connection hides your IP address so that you remain anonymous on the Internet.

### 3. Security

A VPN service uses cryptography to protect your internet connection from unauthorized access. It can also act as a shut-down mechanism, terminating pre-selected programs in case of suspicious internet activity. This decreases the likelihood of data being compromised. These features allow companies to give remote access to authorized users over their business networks.

## How does a VPN work?

A VPN connection redirects data packets from your machine to another remote server before sending them to third parties over the internet. Key principles behind VPN technology include:

### Tunneling protocol

A virtual private network essentially creates a secure data tunnel between your local machine and another VPN server at a location that is thousands of miles away. When you go online, this VPN server becomes the source of all your data. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties can no longer see the contents of your internet traffic. 

### Encryption

VPN protocols like IPSec scramble your data before sending them through the data tunnel. IPsec is a protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a data stream. The VPN service acts as a filter, making your data unreadable at one end and only decoding it at the other — this prevents personal data misuse, even if your network connection were to be compromised. Network traffic is no longer vulnerable to attack, and your internet connection is secure.
