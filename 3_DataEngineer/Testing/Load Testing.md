[[Testing]]

****Load testing**** is a type of [Performance Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/performance-testing-software-testing/) that determines the performance of a system, software product, or software application under real-life-based load conditions. This article focuses on discussing load testing in detail.

## What is Load Testing?

Load testing determines the behavior of the application when multiple users use it at the same time. It is the response of the system measured under varying load conditions. 

1. The load testing is carried out for normal and extreme load conditions. 
2. Load testing is a type of performance testing that simulates a real-world load on a system or application to see how it performs under stress. 
3. The goal of load testing is to identify bottlenecks and determine the maximum number of users or transactions the system can handle. 
4. It is an important aspect of software testing as it helps ensure that the system can handle the expected usage levels and identify any potential issues before the system is deployed to production.

During load testing, various scenarios are simulated to test the system’s behavior under different load conditions. This can include simulating a high number of concurrent users, simulating numerous requests, and simulating heavy network traffic. The system’s performance is then measured and analyzed to identify any bottlenecks or issues that may occur.
