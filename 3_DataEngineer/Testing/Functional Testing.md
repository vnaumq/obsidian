### What is Functional Testing?

Functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies the functionality of a software system or application by checking that ensuring that the system behaves according to the specified functional requirements and meets the intended business needs.

The goal of functional testing is to validate the system’s features, capabilities, and interactions with different components. It involves testing the software’s input and output, data manipulation, user interactions, and the system’s response to various scenarios and conditions. Functional testing is only concerned with validating if a system works as intended.

**Example of Functional Testing**

Consider the example of testing a login feature. When you perform functional testing in this context, you verify that users can log in when the credentials are submitted, see the right error messages upon submitting incorrect credentials and reset their password easily.
