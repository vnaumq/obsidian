[[Testing]]

A/B testing (also known as [split testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/split-testing/) or [bucket testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/bucket-testing/)) is a methodology for comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. It works by showing two variants of a page to users at random and using statistical analysis to determine which variation achieves better results for your conversion goals.![[ab-testing-image.webp]]
In practice, this is how A/B testing works:

- Creating two versions of a page - the original (control or A) and a modified version (variation or B)
- Randomly splitting your traffic between these versions
- Measuring user engagement through a dashboard
- Analyzing results to determine if the changes had positive, negative, or neutral effects

The changes you test can range from simple adjustments (like a headline or button) to complete page redesigns. By measuring the impact of each change, A/B testing turns [website optimization](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/website-optimization/) from guesswork into data-informed decisions, shifting conversations from "we think" to "we know."

As visitors are served either the control or variation, their engagement with each experience is measured and collected in a dashboard and analyzed through a statistical engine. You can then determine whether changing the experience (variation or B) had a positive, negative or neutral effect against the baseline (control or A).

## How to do A/B testing

The following is an A/B testing framework you can use to start running tests:

### 1. Collect data

- Use analytics tools like Google Analytics to identify opportunities
- Focus on high-traffic areas through heatmaps
- Look for pages with high drop-off rates

### 2. Set clear goals

- Define specific metrics to improve
- Establish measurement criteria
- Set target improvements

### 3. Create test hypothesis

- Form clear predictions
- Base ideas on existing data
- Prioritize by potential impact

### 4. Design variations

- Make specific, measurable changes
- Ensure proper tracking
- Test technical implementation

### 5. Run the experiment

- Split traffic randomly
- Monitor for issues
- Collect data systematically

### 6. Analyze results

- Check statistical significance
- Review all metrics
- Document learnings
